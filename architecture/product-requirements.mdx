# Private Markets Marketplace
## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
Build a B2B-first private markets marketplace that enables wealth managers (IFAs) to access, negotiate, and transact private securities offered via verified deal originators. The platform supports multiple tranches per security, variable pricing, compliance-led approvals, and order/RFQ workflows.

The platform is designed to be:
- Compliance-first
- Workflow-driven (approvals, entitlements, audits)
- Extensible toward agent-based automation in Phase 2

## 2. Target Users & Personas

### 2.1 Primary Users

#### Independent Financial Advisors (IFAs)
- Act on behalf of end-clients
- Create and manage client profiles
- Place orders and RFQs on private securities

#### Deal Originators (preferred term over "Deal Bringer")
- Source and list private securities
- Define tranches, quantities, and prices
- Approve or reject orders and RFQs

#### Compliance Users
- Review and approve marketplace-visible changes
- Approve KYC for IFAs and Deal Originators
- Act as a gatekeeper for regulatory hygiene

#### Admin Users
- System-level administrators
- Manage user roles and entitlements
- Cannot be created or promoted by other admins

#### Clients (Non-platform Users)
- End investors represented by IFAs
- Do not log in to the platform
- Exist as managed resources under IFAs

# PrivexPro User Credentials

## Test Users Created

All users have been created in both Supabase Auth and the database. Username and password are the same for simplicity.

### User Accounts

| Role | Email | Password | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| **ADMIN** | `admin@privexpro.com` | `admin` | ACTIVE |
| **COMPLIANCE** | `compliance@privexpro.com` | `compliance` | ACTIVE |
| **IFA** | `ifa@privexpro.com` | `ifa` | ACTIVE |
| **DEAL_ORIGINATOR** | `dealoriginator@privexpro.com` | `dealoriginator` | ACTIVE |

## Usage

### Sign In
1. Navigate to http://localhost:4000/auth/signin
2. Enter the email and password for the desired role
3. You'll be authenticated and redirected based on your role

## Creating More Users

### Option 1: Using the Seed Script
```bash
cd backend
npm run seed:users
```

### Option 2: Using MCP Script (when DB connection fails)
```bash
cd backend
npx tsx src/db/seed-users-mcp.ts
```

This will create auth users and provide SQL statements to insert into the database.

### Option 3: Manual Signup
1. Go to http://localhost:4000/auth/signup
2. Fill in the form
3. Select your role (ADMIN cannot be selected)
4. Complete KYC (will be pending Compliance approval)

## Notes

- All seeded users are in **ACTIVE** status (no KYC required for testing)
- Passwords are simple for development/testing purposes
- In production, enforce strong password policies
- Users can change their passwords after first login

## Security Reminder

⚠️ **These credentials are for development only!**

- Change passwords in production
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable 2FA for production
- Rotate credentials regularly
